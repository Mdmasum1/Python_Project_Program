**Some companies sell innovative (and pricey) “automation solutions,” 
usually marketed as robotic process automation (RPA). These products are 
effectively no different than the Python scripts you can make yourself with 
the pyautogui module, which has functions for simulating mouse movements, button clicks, and mouse wheel scrolls. This chapter covers only 
a subset of PyAutoGUI’s features; you can find the full documentation .

***To install PyAutoGUI using pip, you can use the following command in your command prompt or terminal:
--->pip install pyautogui
